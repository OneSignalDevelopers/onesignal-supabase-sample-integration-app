# OneSignal + Supabase Sample Integration App
OneSignal makes engaging customers simple and is the fastest, most reliable service to send push notifications, in-app messages, SMS, and emails.

This repo contains the companion app to the [Onesignal + Supabase Sample Integration guide](https://github.com/onesignaldevelopers/onesignal-supabase-sample-integration-supabase).

![App demo](readme_assets/push-notification-demo.gif)

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Follow the integration guide to succesfully test the integration end-to-end. The [Supabase](https://github.com/onesignaldevelopers/onesignal-supabase-sample-integration-supabase) and [Next.js](https://github.com/onesignaldevelopers/onesignal-supabase-sample-integration-api) projects must be running first.

## üö¶ Getting Started

1. Run `cp .env.example .env.local` to duplicate the environment file template and set their values based on what you setup in the [integration guide](https://github.com/onesignaldevelopers/onesignal-supabase-sample-integration-supabase).
2. If you're building for iOS, update the app's bundle and group IDs with the identifier you setup in Apple Developer Network ![runner](/readme_assets/runner-capabilities.png) ![nse](/readme_assets/nse-capabilities.png)

Your project diff should look similar to this üëá after the changes.

3. Run `flutter start` to launch the app on your iOS device or emulator (iOS Simulator doesn't support push notifications).

## How it works

Todo: graphic 

### Setting External User ID

The EUID is when the user signs up or logs in.

https://github.com/OneSignalDevelopers/onesignal-supabase-sample-integration-app/blob/0277752c4e88d7e4b13bbb20af84a6700d9e141b/lib/screens/auth/login_screen.dart#L51-L59

### Triggering an In-App Message

Prompt user for notification consent upon completing purchase with an in-app message.
